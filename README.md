## 1. Why use `@genese/complexity` ?

`@genese/complexity` is an audit tool which allows you to identify quickly the bad practices concerning cognitive or cyclomatic complexity.
You will be able to find quickly the methods with too high complexity index or which should be examined carefully.
`@genese/complexity` is available for JS, TS, JSX, TSX and JAVA.

[Top](#table-of-contents)
## 2. Installation

`@genese/complexity` is used through the [@genese/cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@genese/cli). You need to install it first:

```sh
npm i -g @genese/cli
```

Then, you can install the complexity module:

```sh
npm i -g @genese/complexity
```

[Top](#table-of-contents)
## 3. Usage

`@genese/complexity` is launched with the Genese CLI module. The main command-line is

```sh
genese cpx [pathDir]
```

The "pathDir" param is the folder of the project to audit. It can be relative or absolute.

***Example:***
```sh
genese cpx ./src
```

By default, `@genese/complexity` is launched for TS files.
You can modify this with the `-l` option

***Exemple:***
```sh
genese cpx -l java ./src
```
Available options are: `ts`, `js`, `tsx`, `jsx` and `java`.

This command line will generate a report in the folder `genese/complexity/reports` (it can be customized) named `folder-report.html`. You just need to open it in a browser to display the results.

[Top](#table-of-contents)
## 4. Interpretation of results

### 4.1 Folder reports

The dashboard's header presents the global statistics of the analyzed project. These scores will give you an overview of its global complexity.

The main part of the page consist in two pairs of charts : the left one is about cognitive complexity and the other one about cyclomatic complexity. The "doughnut chart" is an overview of the distribution of the project's methods statuses (correct, warning and error). The statistics near this chart are reminding warning and error thresholds (which can be customized), and display the number of methods by status.

The bar charts display the number of methods by complexity score.

Below these charts, the first array displays the detailed information of each subfolder. The second presents information of the files inside the current folder (but not inside its subfolders), and the third array displays the complexity indexes of each method of each file located in the current folder or its subfolders, sorted by decreasing cognitive complexity index.

### 4.2 File reports

As folder reports, the file reports display complexity statistics of files methods. In addition, you will find detailed information of each of these methods, with explanations of the calculation mode of their cognitive complexity.

[Top](#table-of-contents)
## 5. Configuration

Some parameters are configurable by creating a file `geneseconfig.json` located on the folder where you enter the command-line. This file must have this format :

 ```json
{
    "complexity": {
        "option": "value"
    }
}
```

### 5.1 Thresholds

You can customize the warning and error thresholds of each kind of complexity like this :

 ```json
{
    "complexity": {
        "cognitiveCpx": {
            "errorThreshold": 15,
            "warningThreshold": 10
        },
        "cyclomaticCpx": {
            "errorThreshold": 15,
            "warningThreshold": 10
        },
    }
}
```

The values by default are :

 ```json
{
    "complexity": {
        "cognitiveCpx": {
            "errorThreshold": 10,
            "warningThreshold": 5
        },
        "cyclomaticCpx": {
            "errorThreshold": 10,
            "warningThreshold": 5
        },
    }
}
```

### 5.2 Folders to ignore

You can ignore some folders like this :

```json
{
    "complexity": {
        "ignore": [
            ".git",
            ".idea",
            "api",
            "/node_modules",
            "./genese"
        ]
    }
}
```

The folders ignored by default are `/node_modules` and `./genese`.

### 5.3 Path of folder to analyse

By default, the folder to analyse is the folder where you enter the command-line. You can change it like this :

```json
{
    "complexity": {
        "pathFolderToAnalyze": "./src/"
    }
}
```

The last character must be a slash.

### 5.4 Reports path

By default, the genese complexity report will be located here : `current_folder/genese/`. You can change it like this:

```json
{
    "complexity": {
        "pathReports": "./my-report-folder"
    }
}
```

## 6. Documentation

### 6.1 Cyclomatic complexity

The cyclomatic complexity is defined as below :

>#### Cyclomatic Complexity
> The cyclomatic complexity is a quantitative measure of the number of linearly independent paths through a program’s source code

This notion is a good way to calculate the number of unit tests that we must do to validate the behavior of a method for every possible case. The cyclomatic complexity is highly correlated to the time required to cover all the source code by unit tests.

The force of the cyclomatic complexity is its simplicity: approximately, all breakflows (for, if, switch, ...) increase the complexity score of 1. However, this score is weakly correlated to the maintainability of the source code, which is much more important: even if your code coverage is excellent, a source code which is too complex to understand will be unmaintainable.

If you are a human, you will read your code differently than a machine would do it. So if you want to know if your code is really maintainable, you must look at its cognitive complexity.

### 6.2 Cognitive complexity

#### 6.2.1 Definition

The cognitive complexity could be defined as below :

>#### Cognitive Complexity
> The Cognitive Complexity is a quantitative measure of the time required for a human to understand a program’s source code


A project is maintainable if each method of each file is easy to understand. That is the goal of the cognitive complexity, which should be seen as the most important indicator of code maintainability.

The definition above needs to be clarified: what is difficult to understand and what is not ? Is an `if - else` more complex than a `for`, a `while` or a `switch` ? How many times a recursive method is more complex than a "normal" one ? Optional chaining or nullish coalescing clearly decrease the complexity of a method, but in which proportion ? There are no indisputable responses.

That's why we need to weight each complexity factor with a value which corresponds to its relative difficulty. To be able to do that, we need at first to define the measure unit of cognitive complexity.

#### 6.2.2 Measure unit

A measure unit must be relative to an "atomic" piece of code, something which can be defined accurately. That's why we will use the definition below :

>#### Measure unit
> The measure unit of the Cognitive Complexity is the time required for a human to understand the logic door `if`.

With this measure unit, we can calculate the Cognitive Complexity of any method by comparing the time needed to understand it with the time required to understand the logic door `if`. For example, a method with a Cognitive Complexity of 10 is a method which needs the same time to understand than a method with 10 `if`.

We must insist on an important point : the measure unit must be defined in relation with an "atomic" piece of code. It is necessary to be able to quantify it "in the reality", *ie* by measuring the average time to understand it. That's why we define the measure unit of Cognitive Complexity with the "logic door `if`" and not with a `if` "with something inside".

Let us try to be more explicit: the code below is not atomic, because there is a `console.log` inside it. Admittedly, the difficulty of a `console.log` is low, but not null. That's why we can't use this code as measure unit.
```ts
if (a) {
    console.log(a);
}
```

We have the same problem with the next code, which is not atomic too. The `a` is not "nothing" and me bust be understand too. Moreover, `if(a)` have different significations according to the used language. For example, in JavaScript and TypeScript, it doesn't mean "if a is true" but "if a is not a falsy value", which is slightly different.
```ts
if (a) {

}
```
The only real "atomic" code is the "mathematic" `if`, understood as a pure logic door :
```ts
if () {

}
```

#### 6.2.3 Complexity Index

With the definition of the measure unit of the cognitive complexity, we can now define the Cognitive Complexity Index :

> #### Cognitive Complexity Index
> The Cognitive Complexity Index is the measure of the Cognitive Complexity of a program’s source code by considering the logic door `if` as measure unit.

In `@genese/complexity` module the expression "Complexity Index" will always imply "Cognitive Complexity Index". The following chapters provide an overview of the different ways to evaluate this Complexity Index.

### 6.3 Complexity Factors

The Complexity Index depends on multiple factors of different weights which can be grouped in several categories. These factors, weights and categories are for now only based on intuition and feedbacks: ***they SHOULD NOT be interpreted as immutable and definitive values***. These elements are only the best way as things stand to measure the Complexity Index. With the help of the community and the increase of knowledge, the weights will be revalued, other factors will appear and other categories will be discovered.

Every time someone will demonstrate that a factor should be weighted differently or that another category should be taken into account, this page will be updated with a new version number.

#### 6.3.1 Factor categories

- ***Atomic***

Each unbreakable piece of code have a Complexity Index which is weak, but not null. The name of a variable or a method, a keyword like `this`, `import`, `class`, `if`, ... are trivial, but they need to be red, taken in account and memorized by the human brain. A long method, even without particular problems, is more difficult to understand than a short function having the same "density of complexity".

Each of these trivial nodes have a non null Complexity Index due to their existence. `@genese/complexity` uses an "atomic weight" equal to 0.1.

- Example

```ts
if (a) {  // ------------------------- + 0.2 (0.1 for the "if" and 0.1 for the "a")
    console.log(a);  // -------------- + 0.3 (0.1 for the "console", 0.1 for the "log" and 0.1 for the "a")
}
```
=> Total of atomic complexity : 0.5

- ***Structural***

Some code structures present an intrinsic difficulty which implies that the human brain needs a significant time to take in account their logic implications. The cognitive complexity relative to the intrinsic difficulty of these code structures is called the ***structural complexity***.

The structural category contains different factors: the loops (`for`, `while`, ...), the logic doors (`&&`, `||`), the conditions (`if`, `else`, `switch`, ...), the recursions, the callbacks, the regular expressions, etc. All the methods (language methods like `slice`, `map`, `push`, ... and methods of the project and its imported libraries) are increasing structural complexity too. You will find the exhaustive list of the structural factors [in the table below](#632-table-of-weights-v100).

- ***Nesting***

Independently of their intrinsic complexity, some elements add specific difficulty due to the nesting of other elements inside them.

- Example

  The complexity of the code below is only due to the addition of the complexities of the two `if` : there is no nesting complexity.

```ts
if (a) { // ------------------------------ + x
    // ----
}
if (b) { // ------------------------------ + y
    // ----
}
```
=> Complexity Index : `x + y`

If the first condition has a Complexity Index equals to `x` and the second equals to `y`, the total Complexity Index will be equal to `x + y`.

Now, if the same conditions are nested, an additional difficulty is due to the obligation in the second `if` to remember that the condition `a` must be true to be here. This additional complexity is called `nesting complexity` and increases the Complexity Index of the source code, which will be strictly higher than `x + y`.

- Example
 ```ts
if (a) { // ---------------------------------- + x
    if (b) { // ------------------------------ + y + n (the nesting complexity due to the imbrication in the first "if")
        // ----
    }
}
```
=> Complexity Index : `x + y + n`

`@genese/complexity` adds nesting complexity for the loops (`for`, `while`, ...), the conditions (`if`, `else`, `switch`, ...), the ternaries (`a = b ? 0 : 1`), the arrays (`a[b[c]]`) and the functions (`a = b.f(e => e + 1))`).

- ***Aggregation***

Aggregation complexity is almost the same that nesting complexity, but is relative to consecutive elements and not to nested elements. The idea is simple : an array is simple to understand, but an array of arrays is clearly less trivial. This additional complexity is due to the aggregation of the different elements.

- Example
```ts
const arr = a[b][c];  // ------------------------ + 1 aggregation cpx
```

We find this problematic with array of arrays, but also in other cases, like regular expressions : they have at first a structural complexity (a regex is difficult for itself), but they have too a specific difficulty in relation with their length, that is, the aggregation of their characters. increases considerably their difficulty. Of course, other factors affect the complexity of the regular expressions, but we use for now their length as a first approximation.

- Example
```ts
const regex = /[^.[\]]+/;  // ------------------------ + 0.8 aggregation cpx (0.1 by character)
```

Another use case of the aggregation complexity is logic doors, which are simple to understand when they are similar and complicated when they are different and without brackets.

- Example
```ts
if (a && b && c) { // ---------------------- Easy to understand (same logic doors)
    // ---
}
if (a && (b || c)) { // -------------------- Easy to understand (thanks to brackets)
    // ---
}
if (a && b || c) { // ----------------- Difficult to understand (due to the lack of brackets) => + 1 aggregation cpx
    // ---
}
```
The third example is more difficult to understand than the first and the second one because of the aggregation of different logic doors without brackets.

- ***Recursion***

Recursivity is easy for machines, but not for humans. A developer will always need to take care about the implications of a recursion and its side effects.

The category "recursion" includes `recursive methods` and `callbacks`.

- Examples

```ts
function f(a) {
    return f(a + 1);
}
```

```ts
function f(a) {
    return a(1);
}
```

- ***Use***

The other categories were relative to the complexity relative with the structure of the code (loops, conditions, recursivity, etc.). There is another kind of cognitive complexity which is induced by the difficulty to understand the role and the use of a Node. It's typically important when the Node is a method : we need to understand what is its role and how to use it correctly.

- Examples

```ts
function f(a: string) {
    return a.toString();        // The method 'toString()' is easy to understand, no 'use complexity' to add
}
```

```ts
function f(a) {
    return a.map(...).reduce(...);      // The method 'reduce()' is difficult to understand and to use : we must add some 'use complexity'
}
```


#### 6.3.2 Table of weights (v1.0.0)

This table of weights should never be seen as the exact way to calculate the Complexity Index. It's only the best approximation on the basis of the current knowledge.

| Category | Factor | Weight | Example | Comments |
| ---      | ---    | :---:  | ---     | --- |
| Aggregation | Arrays | 1 | ```a[b][c] // ---- Aggregation cpx = 1```| |

## 7. How to contribute ?

### 7.1 Confirm, refute, specify

The estimation of the cognitive complexity will always be a simple approximation. The time required for a human to understand a source code depends of thousands of factors which must be studied severely. Our goal is only to give the better approximation of the measure of the Cognitive Complexity, that is, the Complexity Index.

You can help in many ways by confirming, refuting or specifying the actual mode of computation of the Cognitive Complexity. This page is the receptacle of the different propositions coming from the community. Of course, we accept results coming from research labs or statistic studies, but we accept too the simple feedbacks coming from developers themselves. Each element or idea which is able to improve our algorithm is welcome. If you think that something is wrong in our approach, your opinion is welcome. If you think about a new complexity factor or a new way to estimate some kind of complexity, your idea is welcome too !

Each time the algorithm will be updated, the version indicated at the top of the Table of Weights will be updated too.

### 7.2 Add new languages

`@genese/complexity` is available for JS, TS, JSX, TSX and JAVA, but you can "plug" any language into this module.
What does it mean ? To be simple, `@genese/complexity` parses a Json file with a specific format : [JsonAst](#722-jsonast-specifications).
This format corresponds to a simplified AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) of the source code.
So if you want to be able to "plug" your language into `@genese/complexity`, you "just" need to convert the specific AST structure of your language into JsonAst format.
In other words, your AST nodes must "match" with the nodes of the JsonAst format.
If your plugin is correct, we will add it to `@genese/complexity` module.

There are hundreds kinds of TypeScript AST nodes, so it can be fastidious to "bind" all of them to the AST nodes of your language. Fortunately, JsonAst only needs few kinds of nodes; you will find them [below](#81-kinds-of-nodes).

### 7.3 Add 'use complexity' values for other languages or libraries

In genese-complexity, the `use complexity` is defined in Json files defining the `use complexity` values for methods which can increase significantly the difficulty to understand them. This is an 'in progress' feature, which is only able for now to add `use complexity` for TypeScript methods. We need at first to complete the list of TypeScript methods which have a significant `use complexity`. In a second time, we need to do the same for other languages : any help will be appreciated. And last but not least, we need to add `use complexity` Json files for libraries which are widely used.

## 8. Specifications

### 8.1 Kinds of nodes

You will find below the list of all the different kinds of AST nodes. If you want to understand exactly what they mean, you may refer to the TypeScript documentation : for example, the node's kind `IfStatement` refers to the TypeScript AST node `ts.SyntaxKind.IfStatement`. The exhaustive list of TypeScript SyntaxKinds are accessible [here](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/blob/master/lib/typescript.d.ts) (from line 77 to 447).

| Node Kind | Example | Comments |
| ------------ | ------- | -------- |
| AmpersandAmpersandToken | `&&` | The AND logic door. |
| ArrayType | `a: string[];` | The declaration of a type which is an array type |
| ArrowFunction | `() => { ... }`  | An arrowed function or method |
| BarBarToken | `\|\|` | The OR logic door. |
| BinaryExpression | `a > 0`<br/> `a === b`  | Comparison between two elements. |
| Block | `{ .... }`  | Abstract node containing some children nodes, like `IfStatement`. This node doesn't increase complexity (empty category). |
| CallExpression |  `a.filter(e => e + 1)` | Abstract node containing a call to a function. In this example, the CallExpression contains a first child which is a PropertyExpression (`a.filter`) and a second one which is an ArrowFunction (`e => e + 1`). |
| CatchClause | `try { ... }` <br/>`catch(error) { ... }` | This node is considered as a conditional node and increases the nesting complexity in the same way. |
| ClassDeclaration | `class MyClass { ... }` | Abstract node designating a declaration of a class. This node is the root node of a class. It doesn't increase complexity (empty category). |
| ConditionalExpression | `a = b ? 0 : 1;` | This node is a conditional node and increases the nesting complexity. In this example, the ConditionalExpression node have 5 children : Identifier `b`, QuestionToken `?`, NumericLiteral `0`, ColonToken `:` and NumericLiteral `1`. |
| DoStatement | `do { ... }` | Do instruction. Increases the nesting complexity. |
| ElementAccessExpression | `a[b]` | Considered as an array by `@genese/complexity`. In this example, the ElementAccessExpression is a node with two children : an Identifier `a` and another Identifier `b`. |
| EndOfFileToken | `... }` | The last element of the source code. |
| ExpressionStatement | `a = b ? 0 : 1;`<br/> `a.filter(e => e + 1)` | Abstract node containing an expression, like a BinaryExpression or a CallExpression. This node doesn't increase complexity (empty category). |
| FirstAssignment | `let a = b === 1` | Abstract node corresponding to the `EqualsToken` in a binary expression. It doesn't increase complexity (empty category). |
| FirstStatement | `let a = 3;` | Abstract node declaring a variable (alias of VariableStatement). This node doesn't increase complexity (empty category). |
| ForStatement | `for (let i = 0; i < 2; i++) { ... }`  | For loop. Increases the nesting complexity. <br/>Caution : `a.forEach(...)` is considered by TypeScript as a PropertyAccessExpression and not as a ForStatement, but `@genese/complexity` consider it as a classic `for` loop. |
| ForInStatement | `for (let a of arr) { ... }` | For loop with `in` statement. Increases the nesting complexity. |
| ForOfStatement | `for (let a of arr) { ... }` | For loop with `of` statement. Increases the nesting complexity. |
| FunctionDeclaration | `function f() { ... }` | Abstract node designating a declaration of a function. This node doesn't increase complexity (empty category). |
| FunctionExpression | `f(function(b) { ... }` | Abstract node designating a function expression. Increases the nesting complexity. |
| Identifier | `f(a) { ... }` | The node corresponding to the identifier of a variable, a function, etc. In this example, there are two identifiers : `f` and `a`. An identifier is considered by `@genese/complexity` as an atomic node which increases the atomic complexity. |
| IfStatement | `if(a) { ... }` | The IF condition. Increases the nesting complexity. |
| Keyword | `return` | Alias for any language keyword (`let`, `const`, `var`, `export`, `return`, ...). Increases atomic complexity. |
| Literal | `2` <br/> `'a'` | Alias for any kind of literal assignment (`StringLiteral`, `NumericLiteral`, ...). Increases atomic complexity. |
| MethodDeclaration | `myMethod() { ... }` | Abstract node designating a declaration of a method. This node is the root node of the method. It doesn't increase complexity (empty category). |
| Parameter | `myMethod(a) { ... }` | Abstract node designating a parameter. <br/>Caution : the Parameter `a` is different than the Identifier `a`, which is a child of the AST node "Parameter". This node doesn't increase complexity (empty category). |
| PropertyAccessExpression | `a.b = 3;` | Abstract node designating the access to a given property. The first child (`a`) is the expression and the second (`b`) is the property. This node doesn't increase complexity (empty category). |
| RegularExpressionLiteral | `/a-z/g` | Regular expression. |
| SwitchStatement | `switch(a) { ... }` | Switch statement. Increases the nesting complexity. |
| ThisKeyword | `this.a = 3` | This keyword (returning context). Increases the atomic complexity |
| Union Type | `a: string \| number` | Union of two types. Increases the atomic complexity |
| VariableDeclarationList | `for (const elt of arr) { ... }` | Abstract node declaring a list of variables. In this example, the VariableDeclarationList is `const elt`. This node doesn't increase complexity (empty category). |
| WhileStatement | `while (a < 10) { ... }` | While loop. Increases the nesting complexity. |


`@genese/complexity` will consider all the other kinds of nodes as atomic nodes. This means that every node in the JsonAst which is not in the previous list file will add a cognitive complexity corresponding to atomic nodes, as `StringLiteral`, `TrueKeyword`, etc. If you don't want to increase complexity for a given kind of node, you will be able to set a property "empty" to true in the corresponding field of the JsonAst file.


### 8.2 JsonAst specifications


#### ***JsonAst***

This is the root document (the .json file itself)

- Fixed fields

| Field name | Type | Required | Description |
| ---------- | ---- | -------- | ----------- |
| astFolder  | AstFolder | yes | The object containing all the information about the folder to analyze |



#### ***astFolder***

Corresponds to a folder to analyze.

- Fixed fields

| Field name | Type | Required | Description |
| ---------- | ---- | -------- | ----------- |
| astFiles  | AstFile[] | no | The array of AstFile corresponding to the files inside the folder (but not inside its subfolders) |
| children | AstFolder[] | no | The array of AstFolder corresponding to the subfolders of this AstFolder |
| path | String | yes | The absolute path of the folder |


#### ***astFile***

Corresponds to a file to analyze.

- Fixed fields

| Field name | Type | Required | Description |
| ---------- | ---- | -------- | ----------- |
| astNode  | AstNode | yes | The AstNode corresponding to the sourceFile itself (in Typescript, it is `ts.SourceFile`) |
| name | String | yes | The name of the file |
| text | String | yes | The source code of the file, including break lines |


#### ***astNode***

Corresponds to an AST node of the source code of a file.

- Fixed fields

| Field name | Type | Required | Description |
| ---------- | ---- | -------- | ----------- |
| children | AstNode[] | no | The array of AstNode corresponding to the children of the AST node |
| empty | Boolean | no | If true, the corresponding AstNode will not add any complexity |
| end  | Integer | yes | The position of the last character of the AST node in the source code of the file |
| kind | SyntaxKind | yes | The kind of the AST node |
| name | String | yes/no | The name of the AST node. This field MUST be present in the following cases: `ClassDeclaration`, `MethodDeclaration`, `FunctionDeclaration`, `Parameter`, `Identifier` |
| pos  | Integer | yes | The position of the first character of the AST node in the source code of the file |


### 8.3 Structure of the AST nodes

You must respect some conventions to be able to create JsonAst files correctly interpreted by `@genese/complexity`.

-  ***IfStatement***

   Supposing to be in this case :

```ts
if (a) {
    // ---
} else if (b) {
    // ---
} else {
    // ---
}
```

Your JsonAst MUST be structured like this :

```json
{
    "kind": "IfStatement",
    "children": [
        {
            "kind": "Identifier",
            "name": "a"
        },
        {
            "kind": "Block"
        },
        {
            "kind": "IfStatement",
            "children": [
                {
                    "kind": "Identifier",
                    "name": "b"
                },
                {
                    "kind": "Block"
                },
                {
                    "kind": "Block"
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

The AstNode "IfStatement" always have a first son which is what is inside the `if` brackets and a second son which is what is inside the `if` condition (the curly brackets). This AstNode MAY has a third son which is the AstNode corresponding to the `ElseStatement`, like in the example above.
